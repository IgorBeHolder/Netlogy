    "The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.  \n",

    "Each element `cost_on_day[i]` of the array represents the `minimum cost to travel up to day i`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can then iterate over the elements of `cost_on_day` and update them according to the minimum of the following three options:\n",
    "* Buy a one-day ticket on day i, in which case the cost is `cost_on_day[i-1] + costs[0]`.  \n",
