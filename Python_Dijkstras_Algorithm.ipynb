    "# [Dijkstra’s Algorithm](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2021/10/implementing-dijkstras-algorithm-in-python.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1956, Dutch programmer Edsger W. Dijkstra had a practical question. He wanted to figure out the shortest way to travel from Rotterdam to Groningen. But he did not simply consult a map to calculate the distances of the roads he would need to take. Instead, Dijkstra took a computer scientist’s approach: he abstracted from the problem by filtering out the specifics such as traveling from city A to city B. This allowed him to discover the more general problem of graph search. Thus, Dijkstra’s algorithm was born.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra’s algorithm is a popular search algorithm used to determine the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. In the original scenario, the graph represented the Netherlands, the graph’s nodes represented different Dutch cities, and the edges represented the roads between the cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply Dijkstra’s algorithm to any problem that can be represented as a graph. Friend suggestions on social media, routing packets over the internet, or finding a way through a maze—the algorithm can do it all. But how does it actually work?"

    "First, we’ll create the Graph class. This class does not cover any of the Dijkstra algorithm’s logic, but it will make the implementation of the algorithm more succinct. \n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll implement the graph as a Python dictionary. The dictionary’s keys will correspond to the cities and its values will correspond to dictionaries that record the distances to other cities in the graph. "
